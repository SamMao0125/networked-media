                    This dystopian Alice in Wonderland frame appeared during the final tour of the factory. It wasn’t meant to be anything, and that is why it meant everything to me.

                    What presented as least important - the living spaces of the workers, their families, their children, their pets, their lives, pasted behind characters of fortune and blessing and a prominent future. Doubt more. Trust less. Possibly think about the most unlikely consequences? I don’t know.

                <p>
                    I try hard to see this scene with neutrality from where I was that moment - a photographer.
